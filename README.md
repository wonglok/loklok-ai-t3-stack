# AI stack funz
made with ðŸ’• in hong kong by github.com/wonglok

# Why made this project?
I want to practice making ai coding agent that works and i want to share my creations with the world. A lot of times it cost a lot of money to do a working software on AI coding agent platform. but now we can do it totally free on our gaming desktop machine locally.

## Thank you Theo for T3 Stack
